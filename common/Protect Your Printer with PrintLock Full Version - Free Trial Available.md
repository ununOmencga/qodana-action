## What is PrintLock?
 
PrintLock is a software application that allows you to password protect your printer. It works by intercepting the print jobs sent to your printer and asking for a password before releasing them. If the correct password is entered, the print job will proceed normally. If not, the print job will be deleted. This way, you can control who can use your printer and save ink and paper.
 
## Why Use PrintLock?
 
There are many reasons why you may want to use PrintLock to protect your printer. For example:
 
- If you have kids at home, you may want to prevent them from printing unnecessary or inappropriate things.
- If you work in a corporation or government setting, you may want to prevent sensitive information from being printed and removed from the office.
- If you share your printer with other people, you may want to limit their access and usage of your printer resources.

With PrintLock, you can set a password for your printer and ensure that only authorized users can print anything.
